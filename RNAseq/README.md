# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for Illumina RNA-sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7101-E.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions\GL-DPPD-7101-E.md) holds an overview and instructions for how GeneLab processes RNAseq datasets. Previous GL-DPPD-7101 revisions are available in the [Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions) sub-directory. Exact processing commands and GL-DPPD-7101 revision used for specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and are also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
