# GeneLab RNAseq Workflow Information

> **Starting with version F of the GeneLab RNA sequence consensus processing pipeline (RCP), 
[`GL-DPPD-7101-F.md`](../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), 
GeneLab has wrapped each step of the pipeline into a workflow containing validation and verification of output files built in after each step. The table below lists 
(and links to) each RCP version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, with 
the current RCP/workflow implementation on top. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. 
Exact workflow run info and GL-DPPD-7101 version used for specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](../GLDS_Processing_Scripts) directory.**
