# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for Methylation Sequencing (Methyl-Seq) data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-XXXX.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-XXXX_Versions/GL-DPPD-XXXX.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab processes Methylation Sequencing (Methyl-Seq) data generated using the reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-Seq) process. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).

** Note: The [`GL-DPPD-XXXX.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-XXXX_Versions/GL-DPPD-XXXX.md) pipeline is currently in a draft form ready for review. Example output files for reviewers can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11fEFOn1Br6wJ4g_zBJ0ZkOGPEUxl07ZE?usp=sharing).**
