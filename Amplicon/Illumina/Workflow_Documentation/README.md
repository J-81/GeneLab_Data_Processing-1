# GeneLab RNAseq Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the Illumina amplicon sequencing data processing pipeline (AmpIllumina) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each AmpIllumina version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current AmpIllumina/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and AmpIllumina version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](../GLDS_Processing_Scripts) directory.**
