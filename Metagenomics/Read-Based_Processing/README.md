# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for Illumina metagenomics data (read-based analysis)

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7102.md`](GL-DPPD-7102.md) holds an overview and some example code of how GeneLab processes Illumina metagenomics datasets using a read-based analysis approach. Exact processing code for specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and are also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
