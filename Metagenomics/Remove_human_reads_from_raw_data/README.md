# GeneLab removal of human reads from metagenomic datasets

> **It is NASA's policy that any human reads are to be removed from metagenomics datasets prior to being hosted in [GeneLab's data repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects). As such, all metagenomics datasets are screened against a human reference-genome [kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki) database. The document [`GL-DPPD-7105-A.md`](GL-DPPD-7105-A.md) holds an overview and some example commands of how GeneLab peforms this.**
