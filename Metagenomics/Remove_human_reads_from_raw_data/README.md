# GeneLab pipeline for removing human reads in Illumina metagenomics sequencing data

> **It is NASA's policy that any human reads are to be removed from metagenomics datasets prior to being hosted in [GeneLab's data repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects). As such, the document [`GL-DPPD-7105-A.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7105_Versions/GL-DPPD-7105-A.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab identifies and removes human DNA in Illumina metagenomics sequencing datasets. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. The percentage of human reads removed and a GeneLab human read removal summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
