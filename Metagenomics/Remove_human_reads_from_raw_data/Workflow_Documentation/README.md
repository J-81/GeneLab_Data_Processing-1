# GeneLab Workflow Information for Removing Human Reads in Illumina Metagenomics Seq Data

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the removing human reads in Illumina metagenomics sequencing data pipeline (MGRemoveHumanReads) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each MGRemoveHumanReads version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current MGRemoveHumanReads/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and MGRemoveHumanReads version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](../GLDS_Processing_Scripts) directory.**
