# GeneLab tracking of host reads in Illumina metagenomic datasets

> **In order to provide an estimate of host DNA in Illumina metagenomic datasets that are sequenced from host-derived samples, datasets are screened against an appropriate reference genome using [kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki). Reads are not removed from the dataset, but the percentage of detected host reads is reported. The document [`GL-DPPD-7109.md`](GL-DPPD-7109.md) holds an overview and some example commands of how GeneLab peforms this.**
