# GeneLab Illumina Metagenomics Seq Workflow Information

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the Illumina metagenomics sequencing data processing pipeline (MGIllumina) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each MGIllumina version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current MGIllumina/workflow implementation is indicated. Each workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and MGIllumina version used to process specific datasets that have been released are provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects)..**
