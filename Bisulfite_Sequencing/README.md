# GeneLab bioinformatics processing protocol for bisulfite sequencing (methylseq) data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-XXXX.md`](GL-DPPD-XXXX.md) holds an overview and some example commands of how GeneLab processes bisulfite sequencing (methylseq) datasets. Exact processing commands for specific datasets that have been released are available in the [GLDS_Processing_Scripts](GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory and are also provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
