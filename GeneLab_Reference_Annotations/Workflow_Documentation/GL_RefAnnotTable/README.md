# GL_RefAnnotTable Workflow Information and Usage Instructions

## General workflow info
The current processing protocol is implemented as a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow and utilizes [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments. The workflow can be used even if you are unfamiliar with Snakemake and conda, but if you want to learn more about those, [this Snakemake tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html) within [Snakemake's documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a good place to start for that, and an introduction to conda with installation help and links to other resources can be found [here at Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/conda-intro).
