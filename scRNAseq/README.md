# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for single cell RNA-sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7111.md`](GL-DPPD-7111.md) holds an overview and instructions for how GeneLab processes single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Previous GL-DPPD-7111 revisions are available in the 
[Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7111_Versions](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7111_Versions) sub-directory. Exact processing commands and GL-DPPD-7111 vision used for specific datasets that have been released are available in the 
[GLDS_Processing_Scripts](GLDS_Processing_Scripts) sub-directory. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems 
(GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
