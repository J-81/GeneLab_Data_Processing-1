# GeneLab Raw Data Generation For Bulk RNAseq Prepared With The Qiagen UPX Kit

> **This page holds an overview and instructions for how GeneLab generates raw RNA sequence data from libraries prepared using the [Qiagen UPX kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/next-generation-sequencing/rna-sequencing/three-rnaseq/qiaseq-upx-3-transcriptome-kits/). The instructions below assume that the samples were prepared as follows:**
> 1. Bulk RNA was was extracted from samples 
> 2. Each sample was prepared with a unique cell ID
> 3. Samples were pooled together to create sample pools
> 4. Each sample pool was prepared with a unique single index
> 5. Sample pools were pooled together to create a pool of pooled samples
> 6. The pool of pooled samples was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument

# General processing overview with example commands   

---

## 1. Demultiplex Sample Pools  

```
bcl2fastq --runfolder-dir /path/to/NovaSeq/directory \
	--output-dir /path/to/output/directory \
	--loading-threads NumberOfThreads \
	--writing-threads NumberOfThreads \
	--processing-threads NumberOfThreads \
	--barcode-mismatches 1 \
	--no-lane-splitting \
	--no-bgzf-compression \
	--minimum-trimmed-read-length 0 \
	--mask-short-adapter-reads 0
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

* `--runfolder-dir` – path to the directory output from the NovaSeq sequencing run  
* `--output-dir` – path to the directory to store the bcl2fastq output files 
* `--loading-threads` - number of threads used to load the bcl data
* `--writing-threads` - number of threads used to write the fastq data
* `--processing-threads` - number of threads used to demultiplex the data
* `--barcode-mismatches` - number of mismatches allowed per index adapter
* `--no-lane-splitting` - instructs the program not to split the fastq files by lane (only use if the same pool of pooled samples is run on all lanes of the flow cell)
* `--no-bgzf-compression` - turn off bgzf and instead use gzip to compress the fastq files
* `--minimum-trimmed-read-length` - specifies the minimum read length after adapter trimming, a value of 0 indicates no adapter trimming
* `--mask-short-adapter-reads` - specifies the number of reads to mask if less than the minimum trimmed read length

**Input Data:**
- NovaSeq/directory (output directory from the NovaSeq run - must contain the SampleSheet.csv file)
   > Note: Make sure the NovaSeq output directory contains a properly formatted [SampleSheet.csv](https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/technotes/sequencing-sheet-format-specifications-technical-note-970-2017-004.pdf) file in which the samples listed are the sample pools rather than individual samples.  

**Output Data:**
- *fastq.gz (fastq.gz files for each sample pool listed in the SampleSheet.csv file plus a set of fastq.gz files for Undetermined reads)
- /Stats (directory containing demultiplexing statistics)
- /Reports (directory containing html reports of the demultiplexing statistics)

<br>

## 2. Identify Cell IDs  

```
umi_tools whitelist --stdin=/path/to/${sample_pool}*R2*fastq.gz \
	--bc-pattern=CCCCCCCCCCNNNNNNNNNNNN \
	--plot-prefix=/path/to/plot/output/files/${sample_pool} \
	-L /path/to/${sample_pool}_whitelist.log \
	--set-cell-number NumberOfCellIDs \
	--subset-reads NumberOfReads > /path/to/whitelist/output/files/${sample_pool}_whitelist.tsv
```

**Parameter Definitions:**

* `--stdin` - fastq file with the reads contining the cell ID and UMI (reverse reads for samples prepared with the Qiagen UPX kit) 
* `--bc-pattern` – pattern for the barcode on the read containing the cell ID and UMI; `C`'s indicate placeholders for cell IDs; `N`'s indicate placeholders for UMIs 
* `--plot-prefix` - instructs the program to output plots to visualize the set of thresholds considered for defining cell barcodes
* `-L` - specifies whitelist output log file
* `--set-cell-number` - number of cell IDs to extract; this should match the number of individual samples in each sample pool
* `--subset-reads` - number of reads to use to identify true cell barcodes; to use all reads set this number to greater than the max number of reads
* `${sample_pool}_whitelist.tsv` - specifies the file to output the cell IDs identified for each sample pool

**Input Data:**
- *R2\*fastq.gz (reverse fastq.gz file for each sample pool, generated from [Step 1](#1-demultiplex-sample-pools))

**Output Data:**
- *whitelist.log (whitelist extraction log file)
- *barcode_counts.png (plot visualizing the knee in the cell barcode count distrubution)
- *barcode_knee.png (plot visualizing the knee in the cell barcode distrubution)
- *whitelist.tsv (whitelist output file containing 4 tab-separated columns: 1-whitelist cell IDs, 2-cell IDs that are 1bp different from the respective whitelist cell ID identified, 3-number of whitelisted cell IDs, 4-number of 1bp different cell IDs)
  > **Note1:** Review column 1 of this file for each sample pool and check that all cell IDs for each sample in the respective sample pool are present. If any cell IDs are missing, increase the `--set-cell-number` option by one, and re-run this step. Repeat until all cell IDs for each sample pool are shown in column 1. 
  >
  > **Note2:** If any cell IDs are present in column 1 that are not associated with a sample in the sample pool, remove that row(s) from the *whitelist.tsv file before moving on to the next step (it's good proactice to keep a copy of the original *whitelist.tsv before modifying the file).

## 3. Extract Cell IDs and UMIs  

```
umi_tools extract --stdin=/path/to/${sample_pool}*R2*fastq.gz \
